*Contribution*
Parv Jain:- Add to history , show history , Execute pipes , Exit (Ctrl+c) , shell loop

Rishi Sharma:-Shell loop,read function,lauching,exceuting functions without pipe ,info of related to exit


** Implementation**
>Shellloop() takes user command ,stores them to history, execute them and repeat until exit
>reading the input into cmd 
>lauching the command by converting command into tokens
>Creating process and running it using fork
> History is 2D array saving each command
> If history is full it will drop oldest command
> Pipe function will do command count,if there is one command directly send to execution otherwise call execute pipe
> execute pipes() function creates a chain of pipes, forks one process per command, connects each childâ€™s stdin/stdout to the correct pipe ends using dup2(), closes unused file descriptors, and waits for all children so data flows from the first command through the last
> ctrlc() exits on giving command Ctrl+c


Limitations
>arrow keys can't be used to view previous cmds 
>Signals other than ctrlc are not there like ctrlz etc 
>cannot use cd to change into directories
